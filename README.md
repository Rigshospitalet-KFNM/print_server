VERY temp for now, to run: 
```
docker compose up -d
```

You need sudo permissions so potentially:
```
sudo docker compose up -d
```


Dockerfile: defines the container environment

config/cupsd.conf: CUPS server settings

config/printers.conf: Printer definitions (Where known printers are defined)
